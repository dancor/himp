himp tries to reduce the overhead of writing haskell programs,
especially small one-off programs, by automagically doing/guessing
imports, cabal build-depends, and type-signatures.

Building himp also depends on binaries from: cabal-install, hbuild,
hoogle.  I don't know how to express these deps in cabal..

todo
- hoogle is bad
  - resolve HSH etc not being in hoogle (and FUtil if easy..)
  - maybe use hayoo, but it seems closed-source?
- missing LANGUAGE pragma detection on compile?
